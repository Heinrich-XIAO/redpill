## 10/4/2025 - Add all components and complete schematic  

I finished the entire schematic following this guide: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/guides/devboard but instead of on Kicad, I did the entire thing on tscircuit which is basically an EDA that runs on react. Next thing I will do is finish the PCB which will be kinda hard since the tsci autorouter is kinda alpha, so i'll probably need to fix any bugs i find.
