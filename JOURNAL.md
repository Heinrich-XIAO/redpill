## 10/4/2025 - Add all components and complete schematic  

I finished the entire schematic following this guide: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/guides/devboard but instead of on Kicad, I did the entire thing on tscircuit which is basically an EDA that runs on react. Next thing I will do is finish the PCB which will be kinda hard since the tsci autorouter is kinda alpha, so i'll probably need to fix any bugs i find.

## 10/9/2025 - Move Components into the right place

I put everything in the same place, and I also had to find a new flash chip since the old one was too big. I also had to fix a few tscircuit bugs to get everything to work. Now I just need to get the tscircuit autorouter to autoroute. I'll probably have to file a few PRs to get the autorouter working.
